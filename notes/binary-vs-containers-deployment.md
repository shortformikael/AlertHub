# Binary vs Containers: Deployment Strategy for AlertHub

## Overview

This document compares running AlertHub as a binary versus using containers, helping you make an informed decision about your deployment strategy.

## Running as a Binary (Direct Deployment)

### **Pros:**
- **Simplicity** - Just compile and run
- **Performance** - No container overhead
- **Resource efficiency** - Uses system resources directly
- **Familiar** - Traditional way of running applications
- **Debugging** - Easier to attach debuggers and profilers
- **System integration** - Direct access to system services

### **Cons:**
- **Dependency hell** - Need to manage system dependencies
- **Environment differences** - "Works on my machine" problems
- **Deployment complexity** - Different steps for different environments
- **Isolation** - No process isolation
- **Scaling** - Harder to scale horizontally
- **Rollbacks** - Difficult to quickly revert changes

## Running in Containers

### **Pros:**
- **Consistency** - Same environment everywhere (dev, staging, prod)
- **Isolation** - Applications don't interfere with each other
- **Portability** - Runs anywhere Docker runs
- **Easy scaling** - Simple to scale up/down
- **Rollbacks** - Easy to switch between versions
- **Resource management** - Better control over CPU/memory limits
- **Security** - Better isolation and security boundaries
- **Orchestration** - Works well with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **CI/CD** - Easier automated deployments

### **Cons:**
- **Learning curve** - Need to understand Docker concepts
- **Overhead** - Small performance cost
- **Complexity** - More moving parts
- **Debugging** - Can be trickier to debug
- **Resource usage** - Each container has some overhead

## Recommendation for AlertHub

### **Start with Binary, Consider Containers Later**

**Why start with binary:**
1. **You're learning** - Focus on the Go code first
2. **Simple deployment** - Just `go build && ./alerthub`
3. **Easier debugging** - Direct access to logs and processes
4. **Quick iteration** - Faster development cycle

**When to consider containers:**
1. **Multiple environments** - When you have dev/staging/prod
2. **Team collaboration** - When others need to run your app
3. **Production deployment** - When you need reliability
4. **Scaling needs** - When you need to handle more load
5. **Microservices** - When you have multiple services

## Practical Examples

### **Binary Approach (Start Here):**
```bash
# Development
go run main.go

# Production
go build -o alerthub main.go
./alerthub
```

### **Container Approach (Later):**
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.25-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o alerthub main.go

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/alerthub .
CMD ["./alerthub"]
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### **Use Binary When:**
- Personal projects
- Simple tools
- Learning/experimentation
- Single server deployment
- You control the entire environment

### **Use Containers When:**
- Team development
- Multiple environments
- Cloud deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Need to scale
- Want consistent deployments

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Binary Development**
1. Focus on Go code functionality
2. Use simple build and run commands
3. Test locally with environment variables
4. Get core features working

### **Phase 2: Container Preparation**
1. Add Dockerfile when ready
2. Test containerized version
3. Ensure environment variable compatibility
4. Document deployment process

### **Phase 3: Production Containerization**
1. Use containers for production deployment
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines
3. Implement proper logging and monitoring
4. Consider orchestration (Kubernetes)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start simple** - Build and run as a binary
2. **Focus on functionality** - Get your Go code working well
3. **Add Docker later** - When you need it for deployment
4. **Keep it flexible** - Design your config to work both ways

## Conclusion

The beauty of Go is that your binary will work the same way whether it's running directly or in a container. You can always containerize later without changing your code!

**Bottom line:** For learning and simple projects, binaries are perfectly fine. Containers become valuable when you need consistency, scaling, or team collaboration. Start with what's simpler for you right now.
